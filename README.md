[00:10.98] I know there's no form
[00:13.54] And no labels to put on
[00:16.14] To this thing we keep
[00:18.69] And dip into when we need
[00:21.20] And I don't have the right
[00:23.75] To ask where you go at night
[00:26.34] But the waves hit my head
[00:28.72] To think someone's in your bed
[00:43.72] 
[00:31.74] I get a little bit Genghis Khan
[00:34.87] I don't want you to get it on
[00:36.76] With nobody else but me (ooh)
[00:39.26] With nobody else but me
[00:41.81] I get a little bit Genghis Khan
[00:44.97] I don't want you to get it on
[00:46.81] With nobody else but me (ooh)
[00:49.50] With nobody else but me
[01:01.00] 
[01:02.17] And the lights, they glow
[01:04.79] Like I just lost the World War
[01:07.18] And the scene slips away
[01:09.63] To the evenness I fake
[01:12.42] It's a cheat somewhere
[01:14.78] 'Cause I don't really want you, girl
[01:17.47] But you can't be free
[01:19.84] 'Cause I'm selfish, I'm obscene
[01:35.34] 
[01:22.76] I get a little bit Genghis Khan
[01:25.71] I don't want you to get it on
[01:27.97] With nobody else but me (ooh)
[01:30.39] With nobody else but me
[01:33.17] I get a little bit Genghis Khan
[01:36.05] Don't want you to get it on
[01:38.24] With nobody else but me (ooh)
[01:40.54] With nobody else but me
[01:52.04] 
[01:53.90] Ooh, I wanna make up my mind
[01:57.28] But I don't know myself
[01:59.64] No, I don't know myself
[02:04.19] Ooh, I wanna make up my mind
[02:07.33] But I don't know myself
[02:09.99] No, I don't know myself
[02:14.32] Ooh, I wanna make up my mind
[02:17.67] But I don't know myself
[02:20.26] No, I don't know myself
[02:31.76] 
[02:23.97] And I get a little bit Genghis Khan
[02:27.13] I don't want you to get it on
[02:29.25] With nobody else but me (ooh)
[02:31.54] With nobody else but me
[02:34.23] I get a little bit Genghis Khan
[02:37.35] I don't want you to get it on
[02:39.40] With nobody else but me (ooh)
[02:41.81] With nobody else but me
