Epic Rap Battles of History
Genghis Khan vs The Easter Bunny
Begin

How you gonna battle? I invented hip hoppin'
My little tail swinging and my big ears flopping
The Easter Bunny, baby, I deserve to be arrogant
You ugly, rapist, pelt wearing barbarian
Ooh, what you gonna do?
You've got a bucket on your head and a fu manchu!
The Great Wall couldn't keep you out of China
Watch me rub my foot for luck and stick it right up your vagina

Ha, ha, ha, come on!
Your bunny ass about to feel the wrath of Khan
Silly rabbit, you'll need more than luck
You've got two giant ears, but can't hear that you suck
I drive a Mongol horde, your army is weak
What? You going to attack me with a posse of peeps?
I'll bite off your tail and punch your teeth down your throat
Then butcher your family and make a new coat

Take it easy baby, no need for this meanness
We should keep it peaceful, homeboy, Jesus!
I give people candy, you just like to pillage
Why don't you get out of my face and go back to your village

From Poland to Korea, I ravaged the land
Now my DNA's in dudes from New York to Japan, hah
Easter my ass, you're not in the Bible
You're a fluffy bitch mascot for Hallmark in denial

Who won? Who's next? You decide
