How you gonna battle
I invented hip hoppin
My little tail swinging and my big ears flopping
The Easter Bunny baby
I deserve to be arrogant
You ugly
Rapist
Pelt wearing barbarian
Uuuu, what you gonna do?
You've got a bucket on your head and a fu manchu!
The Great Wall couldn't keep you out of China
Watch me rub my foot for luck and stick it right up your vagina
Ha, ha, ha, come on!
Your bunny ass about to feel the wrath of Kahn
Silly rabbit
You'll need more than luck
You've got two giant ears
But can't hear that you suck
I drive a Mongol hoard
Your army is weak
What?
You going to attack me with a posse of peeps?
I'll bite off your tail and punch your teeth down your throat
Then butcher your family
And make a new coat
Take it easy baby
No need for this meanness
We should keep it peaceful
Homeboy
Jesus
I give people candy
You just like to pillage
Why don't you get out of my face
And go back to your village
From Poland to Korea
I ravaged the land
Now my DNA's in dudes
From New York to Japan
Hah!
Easter my ass
You're not in the Bible
You're a fluffy bitch mascot for Hallmark in denial
